    <p>It has been a long journey to get here. I'm 26 now and still have an issue making stable income. 
        I'm hoping tech is my way out.</p>
        
    <p>Years of trying to find out what is for me. Not the type who settles and takes it.
        I want more! I want to be making 6 figures and MORE. </p>
        
    <p> Im impatient and notice that the years are catching up. 
        I dont want to be 30 years old and still nothing to show for it. </p>
        
    <p>Im nervous. I helped others get to where they need to be. They are not helping me now. I need to help myself!!</p>

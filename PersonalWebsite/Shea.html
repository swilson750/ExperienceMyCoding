    <p> It has been a long journey to get here. I'm 26 now and still have an issue making stable income. 
        I'm hoping tech is my way out. Years of trying to find out what is for me. Not the type who settles and takes it.
        I want more! I want to be making 6 figures and MORE. </p>
        
       <p> Im impatient and notice that the years are catching up. 
        I dont want to be 30 years old and still nothing to show for it. Im nervous. 
        I helped others get to where they need to be. They are not helping me now. I need to help myself!!</p>
